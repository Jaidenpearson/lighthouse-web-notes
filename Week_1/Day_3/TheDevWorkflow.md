# The Dev Workflow

### Notes

- Break problem down into small challenges rather than take in the whole problem all at once.
- process.argv to run command line arguments
- process.argv inputs all command line arguments into an array as a string
- for...in loops through the indexes of an array
- for...of loops through the values of an array
- prioritize using for...of loops unless you need the index for the current problem
- if there is and ```else``` statement in conditions, try and use logical &&. Nested if statements may not work propperly

- Use [this](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) to check code and it will give an explanation step by step. Python tutor is old and does not support new code.

#### Git

 - ```git add .``` will add all changed files in ```this``` directory and all child directories
 - # :q! to exit VIM

- always write ```git push origin``` and specify the branch. will typically be main, but will change once you program with branches.
