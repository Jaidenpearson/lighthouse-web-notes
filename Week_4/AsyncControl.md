# Async Control Flow

- Async and syncronous code blocking
- setTimeout and setInterval functions
- The process object Eventloop
- Filesystem ```functions```

### JS is a Synchronous language

 - All ASYNC code is executed after all syncronous code has already been executed and the callstack is clear.
