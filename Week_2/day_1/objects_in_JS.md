# Objects in JS

### Primitive
 - data type stored directly to menory
 - cannot be changed once created (immutable)
 - Passed to functions by value. Value is copied to function rather than directly passing value in and changing.

### Objects

 - Not stored directly in memory
 - Objects and arrays are always mutable
 - when objects are passed into functions by reference. Data is passed directly in rather than copied. This can result in changing object data rather than copying and keeping the originallike with a primitive.
-  ```this``` is self referential, references the object that it is inside. Even in nested objects, it only references the most local object it belongs to.

 ### Method => function inside of an object


## Primitive Data types in JS
 ```JS
 const str = "hello";
 const bool = false;
 const num = 4.14;
 const nul = nu
 const undef = undefined;l

 const bitInt = 42n;
 const sym = Symbol('hello')
 ```
